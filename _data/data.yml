    title: What motivates me
    text: 'I use Macs since 1993 (<a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_performa/specs/mac_performa_400.html">Performa 475</a>). The usability is unbelievable good. Even as the "flat-design" entered lately and the bugs increased in the released MacOS and iOS versions.
           The iPhone and the iPad have become a kind of constant companions to me..'
