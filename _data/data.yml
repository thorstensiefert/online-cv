career-profile:
    title: Computers & me
    text: 'I use Macs since 1993. The usability is unbelievable good. My first contact with Linux was around 1995. It was a real pain - but I liked the concept of open source. Again and again I've looked at Linux distributions and tested them for my (personal) use. Actually, there was always a computer with Linux on my desk - or near. I prefer the Ubuntu distribution for desktops and Debian for servers. On the 30th Chaos Communication Congress I have met the raspberry pi. Since then I use a raspberry-  and a banana-pi for experimental things.'
